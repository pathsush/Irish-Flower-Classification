## Irish Flower Classification

# Data Source
For this project data has been imported from the skilearn datasets called load_iris

# Data Exploration 
After data is obtained from the library, various process has been utilizd to explore the dataset. It includes the way of figuring out the type of data and the columns included in dataset. 

# Machine Learning
Then, we implement the library called sklearn.model_selection to split the data into training and testing sets. The data has been split randomly because of the nature of the data presented in dataset. The scatter matrix is also used to visualize to detect abnormality and pecularity in data. 

Then k-Nearest Neighbour machine learning model is then implemented to fit and predict the data so that the model can predict the Irish flower with certain accuracy. Also, to make sure the model is accurate we evaluate the model by using the predefined data in our model.
